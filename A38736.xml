            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IN the Dedication of Books, ſuch perſons ſhould be choſen, whoſe Studies or Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agree with the nature of the Subject. To prove <hi>concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in one <hi>ſcience,</hi> by the <hi>Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogene Principles</hi> of another; To make a <hi>Grammarian</hi> Patron to a pecie of the <hi>Mathematicks;</hi> to dedicate a Treatiſe of <hi>Logick to</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104175:3"/> a Maſter of <hi>Muſick,</hi> or a matter of <hi>Practice,</hi> to a man of <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> would not only be improper, but abſurd. You know that in the whole Practice of the Law, there is nothing of greater excellency, nor of more frequent uſe, than Tryals by <hi>Juries.</hi> In this, our Common-Law (and not without juſt cauſe) values it ſelf, beyond the <hi>Imperial Laws,</hi> before the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Laws in the world. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hopes and life of all the Proceſs, the force of the judgement, and the truth, nay the right of the Parties, lie in the Tryal; for as one elegantly ſays, <hi>Qui non probat,</hi> at the Tryal, <hi>dicitur veritate &amp; jure carere,</hi> and indeed the knowledge of all the Law, tends to this: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out victory at the Tryal, to what purpoſe is the ſcience of the Law? The Judge can give no ſentence, no
<pb facs="tcp:104175:3"/> deciſion without it, and muſt give judgement for that ſide, the Tryal goes; therefore I may well ſay; 'tis the chief part of the Practice of the Law: And if ſo, to whom ſhould I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this Treatiſe, but to you, the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticers?</p>
                  <p>I need ſay nothing for ſmall <hi>Tracts</hi> and <hi>Treatiſes:</hi> The infinite number of them in the <hi>Civil Law</hi> (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for every Title, a diſtinct Tract) nay the number of them in our Law, ſufficiently ſhews their uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ringelbergius,</hi> in his Book <hi>de ratione ſtudii,</hi> giving directions what books Students ought to carry with them, when they change places, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel from one to another, tells us, That out of the Volums (by reaſon of their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not portable) he uſed to tear out ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral leafs, and take them with him, in his journeys, and ſo he ſays he had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the works of <hi>Pliny, Tully, Plato,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104175:4"/> 
                     <hi>Demoſthens,</hi> &amp;c. although he had given great prices for them; which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the writing of this Treatiſe, the ſubject matter thereof, being of ſuch general uſe in all Circuits.</p>
                  <p>When I read the elaborate books of <hi>Farinacius de teſtibus,</hi> and the <hi>3</hi> Exquiſite and Incomparable Volums of <hi>Maſcardus de probationibus,</hi> in the Caeſarian, and Pontifical Laws, (which works were ſo valued and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, that they were looked upon as new lights ſent from Heaven, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of thoſe Laws:) I could not but ſee the defect, and want of ſuch books, in our Law: for ſurely they are as neceſſary in the one as in the other. And although I cannot compare my weak indeavours, with thoſe excellent and methodical works, theirs being intire, this only <hi>quaſi</hi> an Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fitted for uſe, not for ſhow: Yet until more learned, and judicious
<pb facs="tcp:104175:4"/> Proficients in our Law, ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the work, I thought fit to produce mine.</p>
                  <p>To compare this ſort of Tryal by <hi>Jury,</hi> with the Tryals of other Laws and Countries, and declare how much and wherein it excels them all, after <hi>Forteſcue de laudibus,</hi> &amp;c. and his learned <hi>Commentator;</hi> would be like the arrogance, of Limning after <hi>Apelles,</hi> and requires the room of a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, rather than an Epiſtle. And conſidering my own inſufficiencies, I ſhall praiſe it more by ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, than all I can: for to ſay leſs than a thing deſerves, would be, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an Encomium, a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore I ſhall content my ſelf only to ſay, that Tryals in other Laws are by Witneſſes only, private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined; This, by Witneſſes publickly examin'd and confronted; and by <hi>Jury</hi> alſo, and ſo conſequently the
<pb facs="tcp:104175:5"/> fact is ſetled, with the greater certainty of truth, upon which the uprightneſs of the judgement depends.</p>
                  <p>It would be well if there were leſs corruption in the returning of <hi>Juries,</hi> but I think 'tis parallel'd, if not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by that of examining Witneſſes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, on whoſe depoſitions, the Tryals in other Laws conſiſt: And ſo that muſt be no objection againſt the thing. I hope an expedient may be found out to prevent the corruption in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Juries,</hi> but I believe it never can in the other.</p>
                  <p>To ſay this Tryal by <hi>Jury</hi> is too popular in a Monarchy, would be a good objection, from a <hi>French-man,</hi> but not of any Engliſh-man, who lives under the beſt tempered Monarchy, and the beſt ſort of Government in the World, to which this manner of Tryal is ſo proper, and well accommodated, that neither the wiſdom of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
<pb facs="tcp:104175:5"/> could, nor (I may ſay) can this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor after ages invent a better.</p>
                  <p>But as the unskilful <hi>Painter,</hi> drew a Curtain, before what he could not expreſs, with his Pencil, ſo muſt I vail, with ſilence, the excellencies of this Celebrated <hi>Tryal,</hi> which I am not able to delineat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make an Apology for the ſtile of a Law book, eſpecially of an Epitome, would be a vain thing, <hi>Ornari res ipſa negat contenta doceri;</hi> neither ſhall I make any Apology for my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking this work: if 'twas better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, yet <hi>Momus</hi> would be carping; and if 'twas worſe, it would be good enough for him, who cannot, or will not, do it better: Be it what it will your kind reception will abundantly ſatisfie</p>

And doubtleſs writing Books is needful in no Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more than in the Law; For without Books, how would the Lawyers do for Arguments at the Bar, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions at their Chambers? Whence
<pb facs="tcp:104175:8"/> the Oracle Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces this, <hi>Omnes debere Juris-prudentiae libris componendis animum adjicere;</hi> That all men ought to addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Compoſing Books of Law; ſome to the Reporting of the Judgments and Reſolutions of the Judges, who are <hi>Lex loquens;</hi> and ſome to the collecting of theſe Caſes and Reſolutions, methodizing, and fitting them for ſome particular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as <hi>Littleton, Stamford, Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Crumpton, Perkins, Finch,</hi> &amp;c. and indeed, moſt of the Law-Books extant, if not all, (ſetting aſide the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) are nothing elſe, but Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions out of others. This I ſpeak, not in Derogation of them, in the leaſt; for as 'tis equally, if not more laborious; ſo 'tis full as glorious, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly to cull authentick Caſes out of the Volumes of the Law, (where ſo many are no Law) and rightfully place them in a particular Treatiſe, as 'tis to report the Judgements and Reſolutions from the mouth of the Court; for the Reporter is but the Courts Secretary, and <hi>Cook's</hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes merit as much as his Reports;</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:104175:8"/>
                  <p> And <hi>Aſh</hi>'s Tables, <hi>Fitsherbert,</hi> and <hi>Brooks</hi>'s Abridgement, are as uſeful as the Year-Books themſelves, of which kind of Collections, one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly thus breaks out, <hi>Quo quidem beneficio, haud ſcio, aut aliud aut legum Candidatis magis gratum, aut Reipublicae magis commodum, aut divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni honoris illuſtrationi magis idoneum, vel cogitando quidem conſequi, quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam poterit.</hi> Than which benefit I know not, whether any man can even imagine another, either to Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers more grateful, or to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth more profitable, or for the illuſtration of Divine honour more fit. For with the leaſt labour, a ſmall price, and little time, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you with thoſe Reſolutions, and Judgements which lye ſcattered in the Voluminous Books of the Law; which would otherwiſe coſt much time, pains and charges, to find out. The thoughts of which publick good, firſt gave life to theſe Endeavors of mine: Not that any one ſhould in the leaſt imagaine, that I am ſo guilty of vain Oſtentation, as to believe, that my
<pb facs="tcp:104175:9"/> Parts or Abilities can perform any thing in this kind, like other men: No, <hi>Ipſe mihi nunquam Judice me placui.</hi> I could never yet pleaſe my ſelf with my own labours, much leſs are they worthy to pleaſe others; <hi>haud equidem tali me dignor honore.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when I conſider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no man hath yet written particularly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Subject, and of what gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe it is, I doubt not, but that this Treatiſe will receive a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſtruction from moſt men, and a plauſible acceptation from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of it, is, in a manner Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical; ſince mens Lives and Eſtates <note place="margin">The uſe of the Book.</note> are ſubject to that Tryal <hi>per Pais,</hi> here demonſtrated; but in particular, the Practiſers at Law, (eſpecially <hi>Circuit-Advocates, Attorneys, Sollicitors, Clerks,</hi> &amp;c.) and all <hi>Jurors,</hi> (for whoſe directions it is of ſingular uſe) are chiefly concerned herein. But I will not hang a Buſh out, to invite, and prepoſſeſs your Judgements, <hi>Vincat <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilitas.</hi> The profit which every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Reader ſhall gather out of it,
<pb facs="tcp:104175:9"/> will ſpeak more for it, than the beſt Eulogical Preface.</p>
                  <p>And for my own part, I profeſs my ſelf to be <hi>Philomathes;</hi> but not <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathes.</hi> And notwithſtanding the hard-favoured objections, which ſome men caſt upon it, I really think the ſtudy of the Law, to be the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Study in the world. And he which delighteth in the Study of any other Art or Science, muſt conſequently be delighted with this. For the knowledge of the Law, as <hi>Doderidge</hi> ſaith, is moſt truly ſtiled, <hi>Rerum Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinarum humanarumque ſcientia,</hi> and worthily imputed to be the <hi>Science</hi> of <hi>Sciences;</hi> for therein lies hid, the knowledge of every other Learned Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>So that he which gives himſelf to the ſtudy of Divinity, may here fill himſelf with holy and pious Principles of Divine Laws: For, <hi>Lex eſt ſanctio ſancta, jubens honeſta, &amp; prohibens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria;</hi>

                     <hi>ſanctum etenim oportet, quod eſſe ſanctum definitum:</hi> The Law is a holy Sanction, or Decree, commanding
<pb facs="tcp:104175:10"/> things that be honeſt, and forbidding the contraries: Now the thing muſt needs be holy, which by definition, is determined to be holy. So that in this reſpect, ſaith <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> men may well call <hi>Lawyers Sacerdotes,</hi> that is, givers, or teachers of holy things. For the Laws being holy, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Miniſters, and ſetters forth of them, muſt be givers of holy, things; and ſo by interpretation, doth <hi>Sacerdos</hi> ſignifie; and doubtleſs, he which duly conſiders thoſe Rules of <hi>Theology,</hi> which lie ſcattered through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole body of the Law, muſt needs conclude our Laws to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; and do ſo much bear the Image <hi>Legis Divinae,</hi> that they may well be attributed to the Moſt High.</p>
                  <p>The Rules of <hi>Grammar, Philoſophy natural, Political, Oeconomick,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi> as alſo the Grounds of <hi>Logick,</hi> and of other Arts, and Sciences, ſo much abound in our Books, that the very reading of the Law, will make a man <hi>Maſter</hi> of any of thoſe Sciences.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:104175:10"/>
                  <p> And ſince <hi>Rhetorick</hi> is <hi>Ars ornatè dicendi,</hi> and conſiſteth of thoſe two parts, <hi>Elocution,</hi> and <hi>Pronunciation;</hi> How can we read in our Law-Books, thoſe Learned Arguments, Elegant Speeches, and Judgements pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ſuch Eloquence and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of words and matter, and not conclude, that Rethorick is the Glory and Grace of a Lawyer? Though ſome (not gifted that way) would perſwade us, that the Law hath little relation to it.</p>
                  <p>If any man be delighted in Hiſtory, let him read the Books of Law, which are nothing elſe but Annals and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of things done and acted from year to year, in which every Caſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents you with a petite Hiſtory; and if variety of matter doth moſt delight the Reader, doubtleſs, the reading of thoſe Caſes, (which differ like mens faces) though like the Stars in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is the moſt pleaſant reading in the World.</p>
                  <p>I thought to have expatiated my
<pb facs="tcp:104175:11"/> ſelf in this Eulogical Commendation of the Study of the Law; But when I conſider the Glory of the thing it ſelf, I think it but in vain to light the Sun with Candles; and as no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments will perſwade one to love againſt Nature, ſo he whom the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Law it ſelf cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to ſtudy it, will never be forced to it with the fiſt of Logick, or other perſwaſion: Wherefore 'tis now time to expoſe my ſelf to the Cenſure of the Reader, who always judges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his capacity, or affection; for which cauſe, if I were to chuſe my Reader, I could wiſh with <hi>Caius Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Quod ea quae ſcribo, neque ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctiſſimis, ne<expan>

                     </list>
                     <p>As to the firſt, 4 things are likewiſe to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the time of granting them, is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on default of ſo many of the principal Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, that there cannot be a full Inqueſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That at the time of granting them, the principal Array ſtand; for <hi>Tales</hi> are words ſimilitudinary, and have reference to the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104175:55"/> aſſemblance, which then ought to be in <hi>eſſe;</hi> and therefore if the <hi>Array</hi> be quaſhed, or all the <hi>Polls</hi> challenged and <hi>treited,</hi> no <hi>Tales</hi> ſhall be awarded, for then there are not <hi>Quales,</hi> but in ſuch a Caſe, a new <hi>Venire facias</hi> ſhall be awarded. But if at the time of granting the <hi>Tales,</hi> the principal Pannel ſtand, and afterwards is quaſhed as aforeſaid, yet the <hi>Tales</hi> ſhall ſtand; For it ſufficeth if there were <hi>Quales,</hi> at the time of granting the <hi>Tales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is to be obſerved, that he which is meerly Defendant, cannot pray a <hi>Tales</hi> till the Plaintiff hath made default.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In ſome Caſes, a <hi>Tales</hi> ſhall be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after a full <hi>Jury</hi> appear and is ſworn; as if a <hi>Jury</hi> be charged, and afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Verdict</hi> given in Court, one of them die, a <hi>Tales</hi> ſhall be awarded, and no new <hi>Venire facias:</hi> and ſo if any of the <hi>Jurors Impannelled</hi> die before they appear; and this appears by the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> return, the <hi>Pannel</hi> ſhall not abate, but if there be need, a <hi>Tales</hi> ſhall be awarded. And the time for <hi>Challenge,</hi> and Tryal of the <hi>Tales,</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the principal <hi>Pannel</hi> be tryed; and if the principal <hi>Pannel</hi> be affirmed, the ſame Tryors ſhall try the <hi>Tales;</hi> But if it be quaſhed, then the two Tryers of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſhall not try the <hi>Tales.</hi>

                     <p> As to the ſecond, to wit, the number, two things are to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That in all Caſes, the <hi>Tales</hi> ought to be under the number of the principal in the <hi>Venire facias,</hi> (unleſs in Appeals) as in <hi>Attaint</hi> under 24. and in other Actions where the <hi>Venire facias</hi> is of 12. under 12. And the reaſon wherefore more than the number may be granted in <hi>Appeals</hi> of the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> part, is, becauſe the <hi>Defendant</hi> may challenge peremptorily; and if default be in the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> then the <hi>Defendant</hi> may pray a <hi>Tales,</hi> and the Reaſon is <hi>in favorem vitae,</hi> and that he may expedite and free himſelf from vexation and the queſtion of his life, for fear that his Witneſſes ſhould die.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the number ought always to be certain, as 10. 8. 6. or 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now by the Statute of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. a <hi>Tales de circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus</hi> may be granted, as well of an uncertain as a certain number, and that by force of theſe words in the Stat. 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>So many, &amp;c. as ſhall make up a full Jury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the third, to wit, the Order, It is to be known, that always in every new <hi>Tales,</hi> the number ſhall be diminiſhed, as if the firſt be 10. the ſecond ſhall be 8. and ſo always leſs. But if the <hi>Tales</hi> awarded be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104175:56"/> quaſhed by Challenge, you may have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of the ſame number.</p>
                     <p>As to the fourth, to wit, the manner of Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that is commonly by them with others; but by them only, when after the granting the <hi>Tales,</hi> the principal <hi>Pannel</hi> is quaſhed, then the Tryal ſhall be only by the <hi>Tales;</hi> or if the <hi>Tales</hi> do not amount to a full In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, another <hi>Tales</hi> to ſupply the former, may be granted.</p>
                     <p>As to the fifth, to wit, the Quality of the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Therefore if the <hi>Venire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> be not <hi>de medietat. lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guae,</hi> the <hi>Tales</hi> cannot.</hi> 3 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 12.</note>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Challenge</hi> is a word common as well to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as to the <hi>French,</hi> and ſometimes <note place="margin">Challenge.</note> ſignifieth to claim, and the Latine word is <hi>vendicare;</hi> ſometime in reſpect of revenge to challenge into the field, and then it is called in Latine, <hi>vindicare</hi> or <hi>provocare;</hi> Sometime in reſpect of partiality or inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, to challenge in Court perſons return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a <hi>Jury.</hi> And ſeeing there is no proper Latine word to ſignifie this particular kind of challenge, they have framed a word anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently written <hi>Chalumniare,</hi> and <hi>Columpniare,</hi> and <hi>Calumpniare,</hi> and now written <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniare,</hi> and hath no affinity with the verb <hi>Calomnior,</hi> or <hi>Calumnia,</hi> which is derived of that, for that is of a quite other ſenſe, ſignifying a falſe accuſer, and in that ſenſe, <hi>Bracton</hi> uſeth <hi>Calumniator</hi> to <note place="margin">Calumn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:104175:81"/> be a falſe accuſer: but is derived of the old word <hi>Caloir,</hi> or <hi>Chaloir,</hi> which in one ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is to care for, or foreſee. And for that to challenge <hi>Jurors,</hi> is the mean to care for or foreſee, that an indifferent Tryal be had, it is called <hi>Calumniare,</hi> to challenge that is, to except againſt them that are returned to be <hi>Jurors,</hi> and this is his proper ſignification: But ſometimes a Summons, <hi>Sommonitio</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Calumniata,</hi> and a Count to be challenged, but this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly. And foraſmuch as mens Lives, Fames, Lands, and Goods, are to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Jurors,</hi> it is moſt neceſſary that they be <hi>Omni exceptione majores,</hi> and therefore I will handle this matter the more largely.</p>
                     <p>A Challenge to <hi>Jurors</hi> is twofold, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Challenge is twofold.</note> to the Array, or to the Polls: to the Array of the principal <hi>Pannel,</hi> and to the Array of the <hi>Tales.</hi> And herein you ſhall <note place="margin">To the Array.</note> underſtand, that the <hi>Jurors</hi> names are ranked in the <hi>Pannel</hi> one under another, which order or ranking the <hi>Jury,</hi> is called the Array, and the Verb, to Array the <hi>Jury,</hi> and ſo we ſay in common ſpeech, <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail Array,</hi> for the order of the Battail. <note place="margin">Array.</note> And this Array we call <hi>Arraiamentum,</hi> and to make the Array, <hi>Arraiare,</hi> derived of the French word <hi>Arroier;</hi> ſo as to challenge the Array of the <hi>Pannel,</hi> is at once to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge or except againſt all the perſons ſo Arrayed or <hi>Impannelled,</hi> in reſpect of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104175:82"/> Partiality or default of the Sheriff, Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or other Officer that made the Return.</p>
                     <p>And it is to be known, that there is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <note place="margin">Principal Challenges.</note> cauſe of challenge to the Array &amp; a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to the favour: principal, in reſpect of partiality, as firſt, if the Sheriff or other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers be of kindred or affinity to the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant,</hi> if the affinity continue. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If any one or more of the <hi>Jury</hi> be returned at the denomination of the party, <hi>Plaintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant,</hi> the whole <hi>Array</hi> ſhall be quaſhed. So it is if the Sheriff return any one, that he be more favourable to the one than to the other, all the <hi>Array</hi> ſhall be quaſhed. Thirdly, if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant</hi> have an Action of <hi>Battery</hi> againſt the Sheriff, or the Sheriff againſt either party, this is a good cauſe of challenge. So if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant</hi> have an action of Debt againſt the Sheriff, (but otherwiſe it is, if the Sheriff have an action of Debt againſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party) or if the Sheriff have parcel of the Land depending upon the ſame Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or if the Sheriff or his <hi>Bayliff</hi> which returned the <hi>Jury,</hi> be under the diſtreſs of either party; or if the Sheriff or his <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi> be either of Counſel, Attorney, Officer in fee, or of Robes, or ſervant of either party, Goſſip, or <hi>Arbitrator</hi> in the ſame matter, and treated thereof. And where a ſubject may challenge the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray for unindifferency, there the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104175:82"/> a party, may alſo challenge for the ſame cauſe, as for Kindred, or that he hath part of the Land, or the like; and where the Array ſhall be challenged againſt the King, you ſhall read in our Books.</p>
                     <p>In Ejectment, the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ſuggeſteth that his Leſſor, the Sheriff and Coroners were Tenants to a Dean and Chapter, whoſe Intereſt was concerned, and prayed the <hi>Venire facias</hi> to <hi>Eliſors,</hi> and had it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confeſſed by the <hi>Defendant,</hi> and the Court took it a principal challenge. <hi>v.

                     <p>'Tis a good challenge to the Array, that the Array is made and returned by 2 Coroners, only when there are four in the County, and that the Writ is returned by one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> only.

                     <p>If the Bayliff of a Liberty return any out of his Franchiſe, the array ſhall be quaſhed, as an array returned by one that hath no Franchiſe ſhall be quaſhed.</p>

So affinity between the Son of the Sheriff, and the Daughter of the party, or <hi>è converſo,</hi> or the like, is no principal chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, but to the favour; but if the Sheriff marry the Daughter of either party, or <hi>è converſo,</hi> this (as hath been ſaid) is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Challenge, or the like. But where <note place="margin">For the King.</note> the King is party, one ſhall not challenge the array for favour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe in reſpect of his allegiance, he ought to favour the King more.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104175:86"/> ſhall have his particular challenge to the Polls.</p>
                     <p>In ſome Caſes a Challenge may be had to the Polls, and in ſome Caſes not at all. <note place="margin">To the Polls.</note> Challenge to the Polls, is a challenge to the particular perſons, and theſe be of four kinds, that is to ſay, Peremptory, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, which induce favour, and for default of Hundredors.</p>

                           </hi>
                        </note> the favour. And again a principal challenge is of two ſorts, either by Iudgement of Law, without any Act of his, or by Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Law upon his own Act.</p>
                     <p>And it is ſaid that a principal challenge is, when there is expreſs favour, or expreſs <note place="margin">Principal Challenge.</note> malice. Firſt, without any Act of his, as if the <hi>Juror</hi> be of blood or kindred to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, <hi>Conſanguineus,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>ex Con &amp; ſanguine, quaſi eodem ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine natus,</hi> as it were iſſued from the ſame blood; and this is a principal challenge, for that the Law preſumeth that one Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Kindred.</note> doth favour another, before a ſtranger, and how far remote ſoever he is of kindred, yet the challenge is good. And if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> challenge a <hi>Juror</hi> for kindred to the <hi>Defendant,</hi> it is no Counterplea, to ſay that he is of kindred alſo to the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> though he be in a nearer degree. For the words of the <hi>Venire facias,</hi> forbid the <hi>Juror</hi> to be of kindred to either party.</p>
                     <p>If a body politick or incorporate, ſole or <note place="margin">Bodies Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</note> aggregate of many, bring any action that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104175:91"/> concerns their body politick or incorporate, if the <hi>Juror</hi> be of kindred to any that is of that body (although the body politick or incorporate can have no kindred, yet) for that thoſe bodies conſiſt of natural perſons, it is a principal challenge. A Baſtard cannot be of kindred to any, and therefore it can be no principal challenge. And here it is to be known, that <hi>Affinitas,</hi> Affinity <note place="margin">Affinity.</note> hath in Law two ſenſes. In its proper ſenſe it is taken for that nearneſs that is gotten by marriage, <hi>Cum duae cognationes inter ſe diviſae per nuptias copulantur, &amp; altera ad alterius fines accedit, &amp; inde dicitur Affinis.</hi> In a larger ſenſe <hi>Affinitas</hi> is taken alſo for Conſanguinity and kindred, as in the Writ of <hi>Venire facias,</hi> and other-where. Affinity, or Alliance by Marriage, is a principal chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and equivalent for Conſanguinity, when it is between either of the parties, as if the <hi>Palintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant</hi> marry the Daughter, or Couſin of the <hi>Juror,</hi> or the <hi>Juror</hi> marry the Daughter or Couſin of the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant,</hi> and the ſame continues, or iſſue be had. But if the Son of the <hi>Juror</hi> hath married the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> this is no principal chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, but to the favour, becauſe it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parties. Much more may be ſaid hereof, <hi>ſed ſumma ſequor faſtigia rerum.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>'Tis a good challenge to ſay the <hi>Juror</hi> was attainted in an <hi>Attaint,</hi> or Writ of Conſpiracy, but attainder in a Writ of Forgery of falſe Deeds, upon the Statute 1 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 3. but 'tis upon 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 14. is not, becauſe this Attainder is given of late time by the Statute 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 55.</p>
                     <p>In a Writ of Conſpiracy 'tis a principal challenge, that the <hi>Juror</hi> was one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictors, and although the Tryal is now of the Conſpiracy, and not upon the firſt point, <hi>viz.</hi> the Felony.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> if one juſtifie as Maſter, and the other as Servant; 'tis not a principal challenge to ſay the <hi>Juror</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the firſt iſſue for the Maſter, but he ought to conclude, <hi>&amp; iſſint</hi> favourable. 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
                     <p>If two plead not guilty, and firſt one iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue is tryed and then the other is tryed; 'tis no challenge to ſay the <hi>Juror</hi> tryed the other iſſue, and gave Damages, of which Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he ſhall be charged if he be attainted in an <hi>Attaint,</hi> for perhaps the <hi>Defendant</hi> will be found not guilty.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And where an Attaint doth not lye, as in Criminal Cauſes upon Indictments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> My Lord <hi>Vaughan</hi> ſays theſe words, <hi>That the Court could not Fine a Jury at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, where Attaint did not lye; I think to be the cleareſt Poſition that ever I conſidered either for Authority or Reaſon of Law.</hi> And one reaſon for this, which can never be anſwered, is, The Iudge cannot fully know upon what Evidence the Iury give their Verdict; for they may have other Evidence than what is ſhew'd in Court; They are of the <hi>Vicinage,</hi> the <hi>Judge</hi> is a <hi>Stranger,</hi> they may have Evidence from their own perſonal knowledge, that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſpeak falſe, which the Iudge knows not of; they may know the Witneſſes to be ſtigmatiſed and infamous, which may be unknown to the Parties or Court.</p>
                     <p>And if the Iury knew no more than what they heard in Court, and ſo the Iudge knew ſo much as they, yet they might make diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Concluſions, as oftentimes two Iudges do; and therefore, as it would be a ſtrange and abſurd thing to puniſh one Iudge for differing
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:104175:189"/> with another in Opinion or Iudgment; ſo it would be worſe for the Iury, who are <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Fact,</hi> to be puniſhed for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Direction of him who is not Iudge of the Fact. But he that would be better ſatisfyed in this point, may read that Caſe, and the Authorities, and Reaſons gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by my Lord <hi>Vaughan,</hi> whom I muſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as a man of great reaſon.</p>
                     <p>It is ſhewed in that Caſe, That muth of the Office of <hi>Jurors,</hi> in order to their <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi> is <hi>Miniſterial,</hi> as not withdrawing from their fellows after they are ſworn; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from either ſide <hi>Evidence</hi> after their Oath, not given in Court, not eating and drinking before their Verdict, refuſing to give a Verdict, and the like; wherein if they tranſgreſs, they are Fineable: But the <hi>Verdict</hi> it ſelf when given is not an <hi>act Miniſterial,</hi> but <hi>Judicial,</hi> and according to the beſt of their judgment; for which they are not fineable, nor to be puniſht but by <hi>Attaint.</hi>

                     <p>And to end, as I begun, That <hi>Decanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> in our Books (as my Lord <hi>Vaughan</hi> calls it) <hi>Ad quaeſtionem facti non reſpondent Judices, ad quaeſtionem legis non reſpondent Juratores,</hi> Literally taken is true; for if it be demanded what is the Fact? the Iudge cannot anſwer it: If it be ask'd, what is the Law in the Caſe? the Iury cannot anſwer it. But upon the general Iſſue, if the Iury be asked the Queſtion, guilty, or not? which includes the Law, they reſolve both Law, and Fact, in anſwering <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> So as though they anſwer not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly to the Queſtion what is the Law; yet they determine the Law in all matters, where Iſſue is joyned and tryed, but where the Verdict is Special.

But all the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſallowed this Exception, and ſaid, the party, in any Title or Bar, needs ſhew no more, than what makes for him. As in an Act of Parliament, in which are divers branches, 'tis ſufficient to ſhew that branch which ſerves ones purpoſe; and not like the Caſe of a Fine or Recovery of 20 acres, where I muſt ſhew the whole Record, although I am concerned but in one acre, becauſe the Originial is intire, and ſo is the Record grounded upon it.

Another Exception was, That the fine was not ſhewed under the Seal of the Court, or the Great Seal but one part indented of the Chirograph was only ſhewn, which the Jurors were not bound to believe, becauſe it wanted a Seal. But all the Juſtices were againſt this, and ſaid, the Jury might find the Fine of their own knowledge, without the ſhewing of the parties; or they might find it upon the Credit of any Witneſs that had ſeen it, and the ſhewing the part indented, is the uſual evidence of a Fine. (Note, a Fine indented and not exemplified under Seal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Jury, 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 25.) And they ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is only the Inducement of the verity to the Jurors, the party could not Demurr upon this; for the effect of the matter is, that ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For the intent of the parties and the ſubſtance and effect of their original bargain and agreement, is chiefly to be regarded in all conveyances; and therefore the Law allows an averment by parol to reconcile the Fine and Indentures, although this ſort of Fine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a conſideration in it ſelf, and regularly by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked averment by paroll, cannot be averred to be to any other uſe or intent than is compriſed in the Fine it ſelf; but by Deed it may be. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. 77.</p>
